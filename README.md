Mapping EPA Air Pollution Data
===================

Created as a project for a class while I was NJIT. I took the EPA Air Data and imported it into a database.
After that, I managed to reference it with Mapbox and map all the sites with the pollutants. Finally, I also made a dead simple way to look up pollutants within x miles of a ZIP code.
